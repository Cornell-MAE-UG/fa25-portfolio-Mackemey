Beyond the technical failures of the Boeing 737 max, the incidents unveiled ethical shortcomings in engineering decision-making, organizational priorities, and communication practices. While the aircraft was designed to remain competitive in a demanding commercial aviation market, the pursuit of efficiency, cost reduction, and rapid certification ultimately compromised core ethical obligations. 
	Should additional pilot training have been required? Boeing marketed the aircraft as a minor variation of previous 737 models, allowing airlines to avoid costly simulator training. As a result, many pilots were unaware of the MCAS and its behavior during failure conditions. When MCAS activated, pilots lacked the system-level understanding necessary to diagnose and respond effectively. This issue is ethically critical because it directly impacted the pilots ability to protect passenger lives, violating ASME principle that engineers must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. 
	The second major ethical concern was the lack of communication. Changes to flight control systems were not clearly or consistently communicated to pilots, maintenance crews, regulators, or the public. After the first crash, incomplete and delayed discourse contributed to the assumption of pilot error rather than systematic failure. Standardized and transparent communication of safety-critical system changes is essential in engineering, where trust and shared understanding are fundamental. Boeing's decision to limit discourse, largely influenced by airline preferences and certification strategy, undermined public trust and ethical responsibility. 
	These failures reflect a broader organizational issue: Boeing's prioritization of airline demands and market competition over public safety. Airlines pushed for menial training requirements to reduce implementation time and cost, and Boeing accommodated these requests to maintain competitiveness against Airbus. While financial sustainability is a legitimate business concern, ethical engineering practice requires resisting pressures that introduce unacceptable risk. The long-term consequences demonstrate that prioritizing short-term cost savings over safety is not only unethical but ultimately counterproductive.
Another critical issue is the absence of standardized, adaptable simulation-based training. Proper simulator training could have exposed pilots to MCAS failure scenarios in a controlled environment. Standardized and modular simulation frameworks would have allowed Boeing to introduce new training features efficiently without extensive retraining infrastructure. Ethically, the failure to invest in such training reflects a disregard for foreseeable risk, especially given the known handling differences introduced by engine placement and software augmentation.
Underlying all these issues is the fundamental ethical question of whether cost should ever outweigh public safety. In the 737 MAX case, the cost and time required to train pilots and redesign systems were treated as barriers rather than necessities. From an ethical standpoint, safety should never be negotiable. Reasonable assumptions suggest that alternative technical designs, greater redundancy, or enhanced training were available but deprioritized due to schedule and financial pressures. The eventual economic damage far exceeded the upfront costs of doing the right thing.
While real-world constraints such as competitive markets, regulatory delegation, organizational hierarchy, and whistleblower risk complicate ethical action, they do not absolve responsibility. Engineers and organizations operate within constraints, but ethical obligations require recognizing when those constraints threaten human life and acting accordingly.
